# SysAdmin-Basic-Automation

This is a plug and play script (all inclusive with fake log data) that automates some basic administration tasks including programmed switches and exception handling. This can be plugged into any environment and run without making any considerable changes. You may want to change the name of some of the output log files depending on your needs.
